# Bright Minds University.
Bright Minds University was supposed to be the university for the very knowledge seeking person with an open mind. I saw it as the perfect campus for people who wanted to grow as professionals and individuals. 

This landing page was one of the first project I made while learning Web Development. HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript for the toggle menu were used to the creation of the page. 

This was one of my favorite projects to make, and although I got helped while making it, I tried to make it with my own style in mind.
